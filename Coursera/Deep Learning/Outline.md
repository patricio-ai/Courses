I know you work really hard and I also hope you feel very proud of yourself for your hard work and for how much you've done.

I hope that you will find ways to use these ideas to further your career to pursue your dreams but perhaps most important to do whatever you think is the best work you can do for the humanity.

The world today has challenges but with the power of a on power of deep learning I think we can make it a much better place and now that you have this superpower I hope you will use it to go out there and make life better for yourself but also for other people.
