## Principles of information visualization
**Visualization Wheel Dimensions**
- Abstraction - Figuration
  - Boxes and charts (abstraction) or real-world physical objects (figuration)
- Functionality - Decoration
  - No embellishments (functionality) or artistic embellishments (decoration)
- Density - Lightness
  - Must be studied in depth (density) or understandable at a glance (lightness)
- Multidimensional - Unidimensional
  - Different aspects of phenomena or single/few items of phenomena

**Graphical heuristics**
A heuristic is a process or rule that is meant to guide you in decision making, practical in nature.

**The Visual Display of Quantitative Information & Beautiful Evidence (Edward Tufte)**
- Chart junk
  Suggests that artistic decorations on statistical graphs are like weeds in our data graphics

- Spark Lines/data words
  Bridge the gap between text and figures.

- Lie factor
  Size of an effect shown in the graphic divided by the size of the effect actually in the data.

**The Truthful Art (Alberto Cairo)**
Qualities of a Great Visualization
- Truthful
  - Be aware of your actions when cleaning, summarizing and manipulating data to ensure you aren't misleading yourself/audience
- Functionality
- Beautiful
- Insightful
- Enlightening

**Graphics Lies, Misleading Visuals**
Reflections on the Challenges and Pitfalls of Evidence-Driven Visual Communication

- The study of how graphs, charts, maps, and diagrams can be used to deceive
- A graphic can mislead
  -  lead readers astray without the conscious intervention of its designer

In many circumstances, truth may be unattainable, fuzzy, or even unknowable, but that does not spare us of our obligation of being truthful

the designer (the encoder) to the reader (the decoder)

**Becoming a Good Liar**
- Not showing much data
  - Hiding relevant data to highlight what benefits us
  - Lies in this kind of so-called *infographics* usually come in the form of cherry-picked statistics (extreme simplification and biased data selection)
- Showing the data inaccurately
  - Using graphic forms in inappropriate ways (distorting the data)
- Obfuscating the data
  - Displaying too much data to obscure reality (extreme and unnecessary detail)

**The Ignorance of Evidence-Driven Communicators**
Visual appeal is undoubtedly a value worth pursuing, but not at the cost of hurting the integrity of the information, as this is one of the main sources for misleading infographics.

**Fighting Noise with Knowledge**
Better prepare future generations of evidence-driven visual communicators, individuals whose core goal is to inform audiences truthfully and accurately, not to sell stuff, to identify the former and avoid the latter.
