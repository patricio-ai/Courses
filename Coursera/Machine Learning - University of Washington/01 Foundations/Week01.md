## Welcome
Together, we're going to learn about applications of machine learning, how to build machine learning systems, and how the algorithms behind them work, and how to build those algorithms.

### Why a case study approach?
**Case 1: Regression**
Learn from the relationship between house attributes and predict its sales price.

**Case 2: Classification**
We're gonna learn some decision boundary between based on the balance of usage of words whether it was a good review, thumbs up or a negative sentiment, thumbs down.

**Case 3: Clustering**
We're gonna try and find structure in the data based on groups of related articles, we're trying to infer this from the data.

**Case 4: Collaborative**
Product recommendation, where you take your and others past purchases and trying to use those to recommend some set of other products you might be interested in purchasing.

**Case 5: Deep Learning**
Visual product recommender, to be able to go from an image to a set of related images.

### Specialization overview
This first course is going to be focused on helping us figure out what task we're trying to solve, what machine learning methods make sense, and how to measure them.

Regression:
- linear regression techniques
- ridge regression
- lasso
- gradient descent
- coordinate descent
- loss functions, bias-variance tradeoffs, cross-validation.

Classification
- linear classifiers
- logistic regression
- support vector machines.
- boosting

Clustering and retrieval:
- Nearest neighbors
- Mixture of Gaussians
- Latent Dirichlet allocation
- KD-trees, sampling and expectation maximization.

Collaborative & Deep Learning:
- map-reduce code for distributed machine learning
- Matrix factorization and dimensionality reduction
- PCA
- coordinate descent
- Eigen decomposition
- SVD

## Who this specialization is for and what you will be able to do
This course it's going to be about understanding at a very intuitive and practical level some very important machine learning algorithms and thinking about ways in which to deploy them in new problems.
